You feel a chill running down your spine, a breathing sound echoing around you. A church. What are you doing in a church. "Is anybody here?" you ask, trying to figure out whose breath you just heard. A small gasp escapes your mouth as you realise the high-pitched voice that just came out of your throat. But there's nobody else around, just you. It dawns on you what has been done to you, that genie must have turned you into a woman. You look down and see a light brown sweater covering what must be your very own pair of boobs. You try to touch them gauging if they are real but your hands seem to have a mind of their own and begin grasping each other. You hear a quiet, soothing voice seemingly coming from everywhere: "You should avoid sexual immorality, as you are told in Thessalonians 4". Without hesitating you begin to speak "Our father...". Only after completing the verse you begin to regain control. What did that genie do to you? You leave the church as quickly as possible, but not before making the sign of the cross with the holy water at the entrance. Standing in front of the church you feel the weight of something in your left hand: A small leather purse. Inside you find a wallet:

As you are standing on the sidewalk you can't help but think that this may be a work of god. Could a genies magic really be that powerful that it even works inside of a church? "No", you think and come to the only conclusion that your lord and saviour must have a special plan for you...
