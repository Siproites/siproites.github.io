#start
Groggily you start coming to yourself again. You have no idea for how long you have been knocked out, that bitch really must have hit you hard. In your mind you are already planning how to get back to her if you see her again as you begin opening your eyes and start to look around.

#acceptance.1
But it seems like I just have to deal with it, there's nothing I can do about it.

#regret.1
Why couldn't I pause and think just one time in my life and think before clicking that stupid button. And now "my" life no longer even exists.
